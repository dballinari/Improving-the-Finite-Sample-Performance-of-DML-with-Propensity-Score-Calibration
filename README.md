# Improving-the-Finite-Sample-Performance-of-DML-with-Propensity-Score-Calibration
Code to replicate the simulation study and empirical application in the paper "Improving the Finite Sample Performance of Double/Debiased Machine Learning with Propensity Score Calibration".

## Simulation Study
The simulation study is implemented in the `run_simulation.py` file. The simulation study can be replicated by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python run_simulation.py
```
with the corresponding arguments.

## Empirical Application
The empirical application is implemented in the `run_empirical_example.py` file. The empirical application can be replicated by running the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python run_empirical_example.py
```
The empirical application requires the "Swiss Active Labor Market Policy Evaluation Dataset", which can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.23662/FORS-DS-1203-1.
